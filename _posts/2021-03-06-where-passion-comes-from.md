# Where Passion Comes From

[Where Passion Comes From &#124; Simon Sinek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoMQaru8zU4)

I could watch this over and over again, In fact I have. In fact, I even wrote
down the transcript because it was so meaningful to consider this perspective.
Brilliantly stated by Simon Sinek, find what you believe in, and passion will
follow. When you put in effort to do a job correctly, you will learn, gain
trust, and you will open up opportunities that will help you get closer to what
you believe in, hard work is rewarded with passion (as an output, not an input).

I didn't start playing guitar out of passion, I believed in the words of great
artists that inspired me. I didn't go into analytics out of passion, I believed
in the power of data and the impact of technology. What I experience now is
passion for utilizing data and creating value to further learn and get closer to
impacting the world in a way that is most meaningful to me.

Finding stress in hard work instead of passion? Its challenging to connect to
what you truly believe in, maybe you just had an epiphany or are experiencing
someone new that makes you want to change. Start local and work bigger. I
believe in democratizing data at work, but I believe in a lot more important
things too. I will continue to work towards those things
and be grateful for the journey as I go along.

What do you think? Does passion find you or do you find passion? Is passion
innate from your values? How do you identify and acknowledge what you believe
in? Please, let me know your thoughts.


## Transcript
~Roughly from the video:

Passion is not an input, it's an output. We're all passionate, just not for the
same things and we feel it when we are involved in something that is deeply
personal to us that is helping us advance some higher purpose or cause, then
when we go to work we experience it. But if you make us do something that we
feel no personal connection to that is not as helping advance any kind of bigger
ideal then what we feel is stress.

**Passionate people:**
 - Go on business trips
 - They miss their families
 - They work long hours
 - They don't sleep

and yet it feels worth it.

People who are **stressed:**
 - Go on business trips
 - They miss their families
 - They work long hours
 - They don't sleep

But it doesn't feel worth it!

**Passion is an output not an input like stress is an output not an input**, so
you can't do what you're passionate about you **find something you believe in**
and **what you will experience is passion.**

So then it begs the question: how do I find what I believe in?

I think our society, especially for our younger generation, puts overwhelming
pressure on us to have a vision and the problem is we're not all visionaries.
It's an unfair standard that's telling everybody to be creative but we're not
all creative. We're not all visionaries, only a small percentage of our
population are actually visionary. **You don't have to have a vision, you have
to find a vision.**

If you hear Martin Luther King say “I have a dream that one day little black
children will hold hands on the playground with little white children” you go,
that's what I want! You choose to follow Dr. King. **When you hear the words of
visionaries and if they appeal to you on some visceral level they give you
goosebumps, they make you excited, they make you want to sacrifice, be a part of
it, stand in line to hear them, pay money, whatever it is—follow that.** Make that
your vision. Take it and say that's my vision too. You can adopt someone else's
vision and make it your own, that's what we call a following, we have taken the
visionary's vision and we have chosen to follow that vision ourselves, we are
followers. That's a good thing. There's no difference between the visionary and
the follower; we both see ourselves in service to something bigger than
ourselves, whether you are the originator of that idea or not is irrelevant.
What it does is fuel passion, conviction. So we don't have to have a vision but
we do have to find one and so:
 - Read books
 - Watch ted talks
 - Read articles
 - Be in life
 - Watch videos
 - Go out
 - Seek
 - Find
 - Listen to leaders:
   - Corporate
   - Political
   - Activist
   - Whoever

And when something resonates with you, even if you don't know why, then you can
adopt and take it upon yourself to use your own talents and your own gifts to
help advance whatever that cause is.

I have a cause, I have a crystal clear vision of the world I want to live in. I
imagine a world in which the vast majority of people wake up every single
morning inspired, feel safe at work, and return home fulfilled at the end of the
day. The gift that I have committed to help advance that cause is the ability to
put some of these ideas into words that other people can relate to.

When you do a jigsaw puzzle the first thing you do is lean the box against the
wall. **We all have a piece of the puzzle to help build this vision.** My piece
of the puzzle is I'm the guy that points at the box! But I'm not the guy who
builds the business, because there are other people who are better at that, the
entrepreneurs and the business leaders. I want them to embrace the same picture
on the box. **The people who work for companies who say, “I want to work for a
company that does that,” that's their piece.** The one who's a gifted natural
leader who cares, we all have at least one friend who, for whatever reason, love
us and care about us even when we're horrible people. For some reason, they
still believe in us and they see the good in us. That's their piece of the
puzzle, and so we have to commit our gifts. The reason they call them gifts is
because they're for giving! That's what gifts are! They're for giving away, if
you have a gift, it's not something you take it's something you give!

I think we have to find a vision and commit our gifts to help advance that
vision, and the **great leaders are the ones that can put that vision into words
so clear that we can then recite that vision as if it were our own.**
