I'm bringing analytical foundations, insights, and operational excellence to a
Revenue Strategy & Operations organization for Google's super-growth SMB Ads
business.

I enjoy collecting new data to build knowledge of the business from engineered
systems (data lakes, data engines, sales platform), then democratizing the
knowledge for data analysis to produce more efficient technical strategy
decisions, effective storytelling, and business alignment to make sales easy.

I'm interested in data engineering, artificial intelligence, finance, economics,
psychology, Earth & biological sciences, philosophy, and things that are
relevant. Please connect with me and send me a note!

In my free time, I am often playing acoustic guitar (big music lover), reading,
listening to podcasts, hiking and enjoying California's nature (sometimes
Oregon's too!).
